                    writer best known for co-founding the software company Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul
                    Allen.
                    During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO),
                    president, and chief software architect, while also being its largest individual shareholder until
                    May

                    Gates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he and Allen founded Microsoft in
                    Albuquerque,
                    New Mexico. Gates led the company as its chairman and chief executive officer until stepping down as
                    CEO
                    in
                    January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board of directors and
                    became
                    chief software architect. During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which
                    were
                    considered anti-competitive.
